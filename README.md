# Matpro Triple Method

A human-centered, ADHD-friendly learning system designed to help children memorize multiplication tables through a structured triple methodology combining visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and interactive reinforcement.

This project was developed through real-world application with a 10-year-old learner and iterated over multiple versions, including a custom-built web application (“Matpro”).

## Overview

Many children struggle with mathematics not because of lack of intelligence, but due to attention challenges, low confidence, or traditional teaching methods that rely too heavily on passive learning.

This project introduces a **Triple Method Learning System** focused on:

- Memory over calculation
- Confidence-building progression
- Short focused sessions
- Multisensory engagement
- Gamified reinforcement

The system was created and refined during daily practice sessions and produced significant improvements in memorization, engagement, and self-confidence.

## Learning Philosophy

At its core, this method assumes:

- Multiplication is fundamentally repeated addition.
- Strong memorization reduces cognitive load.
- ADHD learners benefit from active hands-on engagement.
- Short sessions outperform long study blocks.
- Confidence grows when difficulty increases gradually.

Rather than teaching tables sequentially, tables are introduced by difficulty.

---

## Table Progression Logic

Tables are grouped into three levels:

### Seed Tables
1, 2, 5, 10

These establish foundational patterns and logical structure.

### Construction Tables
3, 4, 6, 11

These build upon prior understanding while reinforcing memory.

### Advanced Tables
7, 8, 9, 12

At this stage, the learner already understands the process, so the focus becomes pure memorization.

This progression increases confidence while avoiding early frustration.

## The Triple Methodology

Each table is practiced using three sequential techniques.

---

### 1. Grid Method (Visual + Auditory + Mechanical)

The learner completes a multiplication grid:

- Reads each operation aloud  
- Says the result  
- Writes the answer  

Example:

“Eight times one equals eight.  
Eight times two equals sixteen…”

This engages:

- Visual memory  
- Auditory processing  
- Motor coordination  

A fidget tool may be used in the non-writing hand to improve focus.

---

### 2. Object Toss Method (Kinesthetic + Memory Recall)

Using a soft object:

- The tutor asks a multiplication question.
- The learner catches the object, answers from memory (not calculation), and throws it back.
- Correct answers are reinforced verbally.
- Incorrect answers return to the previous question instead of revealing the solution.

This creates:

- Active recall
- Physical engagement
- Reduced pressure
- Stronger memory encoding

---

### 3. Matpro (Interactive Web App)

Matpro is a custom HTML-based quiz game developed across 41 iterations.

It provides:

- Adjustable difficulty levels
- Time-based challenges
- Randomized smart distractors
- Score tracking
- Error review
- Bilingual support (Spanish / English)

Matpro transforms repetition into play.

The current version lives in `/app`.

## ADHD Considerations

This system incorporates strategies commonly used in occupational therapy and ADHD learning approaches:

- Sessions limited to ~20 minutes
- Mandatory breaks between sessions
- Physical movement during memorization
- Hands occupied during learning
- Gamification and immediate feedback

These elements significantly increased engagement and retention.

---

## Results

Within days, the learner memorized nearly all multiplication tables (missing only table 12 at time of writing).

More importantly:

- Confidence improved dramatically
- Frustration decreased
- Motivation increased
- Performance in Matpro consistently exceeded passing grades (Chilean scale)

Perfection was never the goal — progress was.
